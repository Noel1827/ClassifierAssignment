COS 126, Image Classifier

/*******************************************************************************
 *  Some people (especially in Europe and Latin America) write a 7 with a line
 *  through the middle, while others (especially in Japan and Korea) make the
 *  top line crooked. Suppose that the training data consists solely of samples
 *  that do not use any of these conventions. How well do you think the algorithm
 *  bwill perform when you test it on different populations? What are the possible
 *  consequences?
 ******************************************************************************/
The algorithm works very well when you write a 7 without any of those changes
but if the person changes the 7, there is a strong change(hopefully not) that
the program will take that input as an error. Therefore, the algorithm will not
do well for the population that does those modifications.


/*******************************************************************************
 *  Now suppose that you are using a supervised learning algorithm to diagnose
 *  cancer. Suppose the training data consists of examples solely on individuals
 *  from population X but you use it on individuals from population Y. What are
 *  the possible consequences?
 ******************************************************************************/
The algorithm may not recognize them and mark an error and that will be
a huge problem because it will conflict the process of diagnosing people of the
population Y.



/**********************************************************************
 *  Did you receive help from classmates, past students, or
 *  anyone else? If so, please list their names.  ("A Sunday lab TA"
 *  or "Office hours on Thursday" is ok if you don't know their name.)
 **********************************************************************/

Yes or no?
Yes, TA Maya and Alexis, SUPER HELPFUL.



/**********************************************************************
 *  Did you encounter any serious problems? If so, please describe.
 **********************************************************************/

Yes or no?
Maybe the multiperceptron got me a little confused but the TA helped.
